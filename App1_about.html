            <p> Chances are, you, like us, have seen the Googles of this world launch their business on promises of "don't do evil".  You may or 
                may not have seen that they have since deleted that from their manifesto.  Along with media reports of the company tracking you 
                even after you have turned off tracking, aiming to launch in China even after promising not to launch in China,
                and, selling all your data to any and everyone who will pay a minor fee to access it.  Are you happy about that?  No, we're not
                either.  We don't have a crystal ball and we don't know that some day someone might come and buy our business if it goes any where,
                but whilst we own mb-deus our promise to you is that we will NEVER sell your personal data.  We may sell advertising on the
                site, but that will never mean providing your personal details to anyone outside of mb-deus.  Our focus is on empowering you
                with your data.  Your health and fitness can benefit immensely if we succeed with this and thats our aim.  Our world is changing
                and if you've found your way to our website then like us you will have a passion for 'getting out there' and getting to know where
                your limits are and then blasting passed them.
