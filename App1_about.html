        <h5 class="header"> <b>Our Ethics</b></h5>
            <p> Chances are, you, like us, have seen the Googles of this world launch their business on promises of "don't do evil".  You may, or 
                may not, have seen that they have since appeared to be shying away from that.  Along with media reports of the company tracking you 
                even after you have turned off tracking, aiming to launch in China even after promising not to launch in China,
                and, selling all your data to anyone and everyone who will pay a minor fee to access it.  Are you happy about that?  No, we're not
                either.  We don't have a crystal ball and we don't know that some day someone might come and buy our business if it goes any where,
                but whilst we own mb-deus our promise to you is that we will NEVER sell your personal data.  We may sell advertising on the
                site, but that will never mean providing your personal details to anyone outside of mb-deus.  Our focus is on empowering you
                with your data.  Your health and fitness can benefit immensely if we succeed with this and thats our aim.  Our world is changing
                and if you've found your way to our website then like us you will have a passion for 'getting out there' and getting to know where
                your limits are and then blasting passed them.

                        <td>Why do we include this?  Because currently we believe Garmin and Suunto etc do not give you the data you should have 
                            access to. In our mind, you own this data, you generated it and you should have all the insights into it that are possible. </td>
