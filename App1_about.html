        Hello, world!



            Chances are, you, like us, have seen the Googles of this world launch their business on promises of "doing good".  You 
            may or may not have seen that they have since deleted that from their manifesto.  Along with media reports of the company
            tracking you even after you have turned off tracking, aiming to launch in China even after promising not to launch in China,
            and, selling all your data to any and everyone who will pay a minor fee to access it.  Are you happy about that?  No, we're not
            either.  We dont have crystal balls and we dont know that some day someone might come and buy our business if it goes any where,
            but whilst we own mb-deus our promise to you is that we will NEVER sell your personal data.  We may sell advertising on the
            site, but that will never mean providing your personal details to anyone outside of mb-deus.  Our focus is on empowering you
            with your data.  Your helath and fitness can benefit immensely if we succeed with this and thats our aim.  Our world is changing
            and if you've found your way to our website then like us you will have a passion for 'getting out there' and getting to know where
            your limits are and then blasting passed them.
