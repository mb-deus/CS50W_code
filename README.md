mb-deus is a website that seeks to ultimately upload .fit (fitness) files from companies like Garmin and Suunto.

At present there is some functionality within the existing Garmin/Suunto eco-systems that is lacking and this website looks to create a 
basic solution to some of those limitations.

First stage of the mb-deus website is to setup the basic infrastructure and landing pages before leading into a Python and Flask/Django based back end, that is able to integrate with a database, ideally on the AWS platform.

The initial landing pages include:
- An index with a brief introduction
- A log-in / registration page
- A more detailed introduction to the business I am looking to set up.
- A history page with a brief history of what led us to create this website
